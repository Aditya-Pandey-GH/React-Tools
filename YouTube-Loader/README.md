# SAMPLE PROJECT

-   This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
-   To create Vite project, use the command **`npx create-vite@latest`**.
-   The code in this template is written in JavaScript.
-   This template contains both `Tailwind` and `Non-Tailwind` sample templates, which can be swapped simply by replacing the files in the **main directory** with the files in the **`tailwind-sample` and `non-tailwind-sample` directories**.
-   Make sure to delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` files and re-installing the dependencies using `npm install` after swapping the sample templates.
